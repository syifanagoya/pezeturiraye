He died on September 2, 2016, due to a heart attack leaving controversies of hate.</p><p>Maybe you know about Jerry Heller very well But do you know how old was he at the time of his death and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Jerry Heller’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>He played many roles in his early life until he finally found his love for music, or should we say business over the music. He was a California university student, Ohio born, served USA army, worked for agency business, and started up his own agency as well. His agency was known as Heller-Fischel, based out of California.</p><p>At the age of 19, he summed up all his skills and business mind before heading out to California and never looked back. Everybody in the industry who knew him describes him as a humorous personality and very intelligent when it comes to business.</p><p>Most of the time, he is silent when it comes to speaking about controversies and claims that he made, but in 2006 he first talked about his life. He has always been a target to put rivalry among the album group using divide & rule strategy. Other than that, his relationship with colleagues and especially Ice Cube has always been sour.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>He married his longtime girlfriend, Gayle Steiner, in 1996 and got divorced in 2014 due to unknown reasons.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 6 October 1940, Jerry Heller was 75 years old at the time of his death. His height was 1.62 m tall and weighed 58 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>His job title was the music manager, which he started in mid-1980. If we go through his career ladder, he established the career of several artists. He got big roles and started doing business with eagles, Pink Floyd, Eazy-E, and many rooted giants. He is proud to work with Eazy-E because that was the time his accomplishments went beyond. Apart from all that he achieved, controversies never left him.</p><p>While he conquers the whole industry, he was handed full of a tiff and fusses, moved ahead with a tag-line of ‘Leave Everything Behind.’ He has been accused of destroying NWA rather than settling them due to many splits that occur one by one. Ice cube and Dr. Dre were the major ones who actually spat comments on him like not being paid.</p><p>The other side of the road is Heller bought this group to international fame and all that started never goes to end, we all know. Rebels opted out themselves or being kicked out through politics, and the rest have been raised to the goal/objective. That’s how it goes everywhere, and managers are bound by this responsibility. Because here we are talking about celebrities, fans usually develop hate for this action (sensible or not), but still, every opinion matters. However, the split was very bitter that followed many unwanted actions from the opposite end.</p><h2>Awards & Achievement</h2><p>A memoir was written by Gil Reavill, where Heller had opened about many incidents like Dee Bernes in which he stated that he cleaned up all the mess. While he denied some and explained some, his rivals, or should we say, haters, never agree with any of his explanations.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Jerry Heller in 2024</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Jerry-Heller-Net-Worth.jpg alt="Jerry Heller Net Worth 2019" width=906 height=498 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>As of July 2024, Jerry’s total net worth is $20 million of all the income sources he had. And, yes, it was all built and established by him alone.</p><p>He has admirers and haters both. Haters who would do anything to bring him down! For instance, NWA produced a biopic film, and the character which played Jerry was somehow the character that NWA wants everybody to see. To which Jerry filed a lawsuit against the members, and some of them were dismissed in 2016. After his death in the same year, Mickey Shapiro called for the continuation of the claims.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLemvtGyZKGdnKGys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWlpaWViZX9yew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hailey-baldwin-kendall-jenner-obviously-knew-nipples-were-showing-w211089.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hailey Baldwin: Kendall Jenner Obviously Knew Nipples Were Showing">&larr;
