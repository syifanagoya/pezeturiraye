At first, the 25 years old Burnett introduced her new beau through Instagram. She shared the photo with Davis celebrating her 25th birthday together, sharing a smooch over dinner on Friday, February 22.</p><p>She captioned the picture: â€œThe present I never knew I needed".

Likewise, the former couple had engaged over the summer in 2019 on <i>BiP</i> season 6 finale. Their engagement proposal made history as part of the Bachelor Nation's first same-sex couple but sadly could not become the married duo.</p><p>Since their division, they've remained tight-lipped over the reasons behind their broken dedication. Both of them have moved with their new partners. Meanwhile, Burnett's ex-fiance Haggerty is dating YouTube star<strong> Taylor Blake</strong> since Feb. 2020.</p><h2>Holds Thousand Dollars Net Worth</h2><p>As a reality television star and model, Demi Burnett has herself accumulated a good amount of money.

Her source of revenue, she receives much of her wealth mainly from her career in acting.</p><p>Now, Burnett's starring in Bachelor of Paradise so her salary is about <strong>$8,000 </strong>per season, unlike Jade Roper and Tenley Molzahn. She also receives extra from her role as a model.
