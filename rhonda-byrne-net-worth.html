Rhonda Byrne earned her fortune as the author of "The Secret," which is based on the belief in the law of attraction. "The Secret" was originally a documentary film created by Byrne. Both the book and documentary were immensely popular in the mid-2000s. The book sold more than 20 million copies in 40+ languages in its first few years after being published. Rhonda also sold two million DVDs of the movie of the same name. The book and film combined have grossed $300 million.</p><p>It was in 2004, when Byrne was having an emotional breakdown for personal and professional reasons, that she discovered the secret behind what would ultimately become her film (first) and a book (second) entitled "The Secret". It was a secret that had been in existence since humanity, yet was not widely known or practiced. A secret that could potentially change a person's life entirely. The moment she came to this realization she just knew she had to dedicate her time to sharing and circulating this knowledge to everyone possibleâ€”it was her obligation. She felt she had unearthed a law that is relevant to each and every aspect of our lives, a law that is undying and eternal; the "Law of Attraction". According to this law one can use their feelings to make their dreams a reality.</p><h2 id=montecito-mansion><strong>Montecito Mansion</strong></h2><p>In 2007, the year of her explosive success, Rhonda Byrne paid $18 million for a sprawling 2.5-acre estate in Montecito, California. The estate, which was built in 2001 and is called Prima Luce, has an 8,000 square foot primary mansion, plus a guest house, two-story children's playhouse, 65-foot pool and direct views of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>In May 2014 she listed the home for sale for $23.5 million. She finally accepted $13.6 million in December 2019. In hindsight, she should have held on about a year longer. In a post-COVID world, the real estate values of Montecito estates sky rocketed. Today the home is easily worth $30-40 million based on similar comps. Here's a video tour:</p><p></p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Rhonda Byrne was born on March 12, 1951 in Melbourne, Australia. Her parents are Ronald and Irene Izon. She grew up in Melbourne and worked as a producer in television and radio in her early career.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>While working as a producer, Byrne worked on a number of different television projects. Some of her credits include "Oz Encounters: UFO's in Australia" in 1997, "Sensing Murder: Easy Street" in 2003," "Loves Me, Loves Me Not" in 2003, and "The World's Greatest Commercials" which ran from 1995 to 2004.</p><p>In 2004, Byrne became very depressed following the death of her father. She was unhappy with her personal and professional life. After being encouraged by her daughter, Byrne read "The Science of Getting Rich," a book written by Wallace D. Wattles in 1910. The book focuses on how to overcome mental barriers and focus on creation in order to attract wealth. The book greatly inspired Byrne and she began to work on "The Secret."</p><p>Byrne then spent the following months researching and investigating some of the ideas that she had read about in "The Science of Getting Rich." She studied a variety of different religions and human practices over history and was impressed to find that many of the ideas regarding the law of attraction were represented across different peoples and cultures. As she began incorporating some of the ideas into her own life, she began to experience a shift in her life, success, and attitude.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-355592 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Rhonda-Byrne.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-355592 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by David A. Walega/WireImage)</p><h2 id=secret><strong>The Secret</strong></h2><p>In 2006, Byrne released the documentary film "The Secret." She followed the film up with an accompanying book. In the book and film, she highlights how many great people throughout history, like Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln, knew about the law of attraction and used it to achieve their success. She reintroduced concepts that were originally popularized by people like Madame Blavatsky and Norman Vincent Peele regarding the belief that thinking certain practices can have an effect on how people can make desirable things appear in their lives. In "The Secret," she provides numerous examples of how this type of thinking has worked for many people. She specifically cites a three-step process: ask, believe, and receive. The process is based on a quotation from the Bible in the book of Matthew which states "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."</p><p>By the spring of 2007, the book "The Secret" had sold more than 19 million copies in more than 40 languages and more than two million DVDs. Overall, the book and the DVD have grossed over $300 million in sales. The popularity of "The Secret" was bolstered greatly after Byrne appeared on "The <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a> Show" to discuss the concepts she wrote about in the book. She appeared on the show with four teachers who had appeared in the documentary. In May of 2007, she was included in "TIME" magazine's list of "The People Who Shape Our World."</p><p>Byrne followed up her success with "The Secret" in 2010 by releasing a sequel book called "The Power." The book was developed after Byrne kept receiving letters from readers of "The Secret" with questions that she then used to help write "The Power." The book became a "New York Times" bestseller and was made available in 45 languages. In 2012, she released a third book called "The Magic." In 2013, she released the book "Hero," which also became an international bestseller.</p><p>Most recently, Byrne has published "How The Secret Changed My Life." The book is a compilation of stories from people who read or watched "The Secret" and employed the law of attraction strategies in their own lives and the resulting successes they experienced. Byrne's most recent book is "The Greatest Secret," published in 2020.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Rhonda Byrne has kept her personal life out of the public eye. However, it is known that she has two daughters named Skye and Hayley. Additionally, she has stated that she suffered a series of traumatic events in her personal and professional life in the early 2000s, which led to her embarking on the journey which ultimately resulted in her creating "The Secret" and sharing it with the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wK6roaeiqHyztM6nm5plkq6%2Fr7GMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dua-lipa-expresses-regret-for-any-harm-suffered-by-fans-during-her-concert-529148.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dua Lipa Expresses Regret For Any Harm Suffered By Fans During Her Concert">&larr;
