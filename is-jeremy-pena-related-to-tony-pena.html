In 1996, he played five games for the Cleveland Indians before announcing his retirement. Ger√≥nimo played in 378 games across seven seasons in the main leagues. With 162 runs scored, 30 home runs, 124 RBI, 54 stolen bases, and 112 walks.</p><p>He has guided his child since the start of his journey as a baseball player, and in doing so, the father-son duo have strengthened their relationship and are much closer to each other than usual. Despite having the opportunity to reside in the USA and become an American national, he first chose to represent his birthplace. He immediately returned to his home country, where he started his family.</p><p>He was born and raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and when he was nine years old, his family relocated to Providence, Rhode Island. Regardless of where he lived, he always had the support of his parents, and with their help and tremendous effort, he accomplished a lot in his first MLB season.</p><p>Pena was the first rookie to earn the AL Gold Glove Award at shortstop that year. He was also selected as the MVP of the American League Championship Series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.celebseek.com/uploads//2022/11/63ea2467-1bd9-44ad-bf42-4a58215546bc.webp><p>He replaced two-time All-Star and 2017 World Series winner Carlos Correa in his rookie season in the major leagues, leaving some huge shoes to fill, but rarely has the challenge felt too great for him.</p><p>He also had a.426 slugging percentage, 22 home runs, 20 doubles, two triples, 63 RBI, and 72 runs scored during the regular season, which was a team-high for defensive wins above replacement. In his first playoffs, the rookie star has already had a couple of standout performances, one of which occurred in the ALDS Game 3 victory over the Seattle Mariners that sealed the series.</p><p>The Astros won 1-0 thanks to a solo home run by the shortstop in the top of the 18th inning. He has a 7-for-20 hitting average with five runs and two RBI through four games of the 2022 playoffs.</p><p>Jeremy is also close to his mother, Cecilia, who has spent continuous hours trying to fulfill his requirements while he was busy smashing home runs. He has a unique way of tribute to his mother during game days. The MLB star makes a heart sign with his fingers whenever he pulls out a spectacular show. Fans were initially confused about who he would be dedicating the celebration, but he later revealed in an interview that it was for his mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOoqpmopWnsq7FjKmcp5ldp7KtrdOem2asn2LBsLrYZqeeppFk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./facebook-equality-meme-draws-2-7-million-supporters-for-marriage-equality.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Equality Meme Draws 2.7 Million Supporters for Marriage Equality">&larr;
