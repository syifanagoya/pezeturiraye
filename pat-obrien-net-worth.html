O'Brien then attended Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, graduating with a master's degree in international economics. From 1964 to 1967, Pat was a member of the band Dale Gregory and the Shouters, which led to him being inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Pat began his career in Sioux Falls at KSOO TV-Radio, and after college, he worked at NBC News in Washington, D.C. as a researcher and at "The Huntley-Brinkley Report" as a production assistant. He then became a reporter and anchor at Chicago's WMAQ-TV. O'Brien moved to Los Angeles in 1977, and he won four local Emmy Awards while working for KNXT-TV (which is now known as KCBS-TV). From 1981 to 1997, Pat worked for CBS Sports, where he covered the World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals, Olympic Games, and more. He hosted the CBS talk show "Overtime…With Pat O'Brien," which aired for three weeks in 1990, as well as VH1's "Fairway to Heaven" (1996).

The name was changed to "Primetime on Fox Sports Radio" after Jacobs left the program.

The couple had been married since 1973, and they welcomed son Sean in 1985. O'Brien began a relationship with fashion designer Betsy Hoyt Stephens in 2003, and he announced their engagement in July 2008.</p><h2 id=voicemails-rehab><strong>Voicemails and Rehab</strong></h2><p>In March 2005, Pat went to rehab for alcoholism, and around this time, sexually graphic voicemails from O'Brien to an anonymous woman began circulating. Pat later said that he had no recollection of leaving the voicemails (which included the phrase "let's get some hookers and cocaine"), telling <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a> in 2014, "One of the byproducts of alcoholism are blackouts. I&nbsp; don't remember it."</p><p>O'Brien returned to rehab in early 2008, and in a 2014 interview with "People" magazine, he stated, "I jumped headfirst into recovery, clinging for dear life to the Hazelden program. Sean agreed to fly to this little country town for Thanksgiving. He made me promise to 'just quit lying.' His visit showed me what a treasure he was, and from that moment on, my mind free of alcohol and chemicals, I pledged to never let him down again."</p><p>While Pat was in rehab, <a href=# title="Donny Osmond Net Worth">Donny Osmond</a> filled in for him on "The Insider," and in March 2008, it was reported that O'Brien would no longer appear on the show. However, Osmond decided not to accept a permanent role on the show, and Pat returned to "The Insider" in April 2008. In September 2008, O'Brien's co-host, <a href=# title="Lara Spencer Net Worth">Lara Spencer</a>, became the show's sole host, and Pat was demoted to a correspondent. Later that month, he was fired from the show for sending his co-workers an email in which he insulted Spencer and said that her segments made viewers "want to vomit."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wK6roaeiqHyxrdNmppuqmZq7brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./squid-game-actress-hoyeon-jung-won-sag-award-and-her-boyfriend-lee-dong-hwi-is-so-proud-243089-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Squid Game Actress Hoyeon Jung Won SAG Award And Her Boyfriend Lee Dong Hwi Is So Proud">&larr;
