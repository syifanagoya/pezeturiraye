Offset is best known for being a member of the hip hop trio Migos along with rappers <a href=#>Quavo</a> and the late Takeoff. With Migos he has released four studio albums; "Yung Rich Nation" (2015), "Culture" (2017), "Culture II" (2018) and "Culture III" (2021). At their peak, Migos was was one of the highest earning music groups in the world, with <a href=#>$25 million in combined earnings</a> in a year period between 2017 and 2018. Tragically, Migos member Takeoff was murdered in November 2022. Outside of his work with Migos, Offset is known for being married to <a href=#>Cardi B</a> since 2017.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Kiari Kendrell Cephus, better known by his stage name Offset, was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, on December 14, 1991. He enjoyed a middle-class upbringing in Gwinnett County, Georgia, along with his bandmates Quavo and Takeoff. They are actually all directly related; Quavo is Offset's cousin, and Takeoff is Offset's cousin once-removed (Quavo is Takeoff's uncle). All three of them grew up listening to music by artists like Outkast, <a href=# title="Gucci Mane Net Worth">Gucci Mane</a>, Hot Boys, <a href=# title="Lil Wayne Net Worth">Lil Wayne</a>, and <a href=# title="Master P Net Worth">Master P</a>.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Offset, Quavo, and Takeoff founded the hip hop group Migos in 2008. They originally called themselves the Polo Club. After releasing their first mixtape, "Juug Season", in 2011, they first gained notoriety in 2013 for their single "Versace". Migos then released their debut studio album "Yung Rich Nation" in 2015. It reached No. 3 on the US Rap chart, No. 5 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart, and No. 17 on the Billboard 200 chart. Their next big hit came in 2017 with the single "Bad and Boujee" (featuring <a href=# title="Lil Uzi Vert Net Worth">Lil Uzi Vert</a>), which actually became an Internet phenomenon. In particular, Offset's lyrics "rain drop, drop top" spawned many memes. In 2017, Migos also released their second studio album, "Culture", which debuted at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by the RIAA. They followed this up with the album "Culture II" in 2018.</p><p>In addition to his work with Migos, Offset released a collaborative album with <a href=# title="21 Savage Net Worth">21 Savage</a> and <a href=# title="Metro Boomin Net Worth">Metro Boomin</a>, "Without Warning", in 2017. The album features appearances from artists like <a href=# title="Travis Scott Net Worth">Travis Scott</a> and Quavo, and peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart. In February 2019, Offset released his first solo album, "Father of 4". It was released by Motown and Quality Control Music, and features artists like <a href=# title="J. Cole Net Worth">J. Cole</a>, Cardi B, Big Rube, Gunna, <a href=# title="CeeLo Green Net Worth">CeeLo Green</a>, and Gucci Mane. "Father of 4" debuted at No. 4 on the US Billboard 200, and was generally well received by both critics and the public.</p><p>In August 2022, Offset announced his second studio album and released two new singles, "54321" and "Code." He filed a lawsuit against his record label, Quality Control Music, in a dispute over rights to his solo music. Offset's legal team stated he paid handsomely for his solo artist rights following a negotiation the year prior but now QC has allegedly attempted to claim his latest track as their own.</p><p>After speculation that Quavo's ex-girlfriend <a href=# title="Saweetie Net Worth">Saweetie</a> had cheated on him with Offset, Quavo and Takeoff broke away from the Migos and formed Unc & Phew. On November 1, 2022, Takeoff was shot and killed outside of a bowling alley after a party in Houston, Texas. Offset delayed the release of his upcoming album. In 2023, Offset and Quavo allegedly got into a physical altercation backstage at the Grammys. But in February, the two cleared the air and reunited for a performance at the BET awards to pay respect to the late Takeoff.</p><h2 id=business-ventures-other-work><strong>Business Ventures and Other Work</strong></h2><p>In addition to his music work, Offset has appeared in advertising campaigns for fashion designers and brands like Gosha Rubchinskiy, Bryce Barnes, and Lavati. He also appeared alongside the other members of Migos in an episode of the television series "Atlanta" in 2016. In 2020, he debuted a new show with Quibi titled "SKRRT with Offset", which follows him as he drives around with other celebrities in fancy, expensive cars.</p><p>In August 2019, Offset was announced as a new investor in the Esports organization FaZe Clan, although the nature and amount of the investment was undisclosed. He has since appeared in two FaZe Clan videos on YouTube. He made his acting debut in NCIS: Los Angeles and has helped struggling artists by jointing Axis Replay in 2020. After losing his mother to bladder cancer in 2012, Offset raised $500,000 for the American Cancer Society.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-307452 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Offset.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-307452 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Bryan Steffy/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life-legal-issues><strong>Personal Life and Legal Issues</strong></h2><p>Offset began dating fellow American rapper Cardi B in 2017. They secretly got married in Georgia in September 2017, but do not announce it publicly—their marriage date was only revealed in June 2018, after celebrity gossip site TMZ tracked down their wedding certificate. Despite already being married, Offset publicly proposed to Cardi during a live performance in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 27, 2017. In April 2018, Cardi announced to the world during an appearance on the television show "Saturday Night Live" that she and Offset were expecting their first child together. Their daughter, Kulture Kiari Cephus, was born on July 10, 2018. Offset has three other children, sons Jordan and Kody, and daughter Kalea, from early relationships. Offset and Cardi have had a tumultuous on-and-off relationship, fueled by rumors of infidelity by Offset.</p><p>On September 15, 2020, Cardi B filed for divorce from Offset. In the divorce filing Cardi requested primary physical custody of their daughter Kulture, child support and an equitable division of assets because there was apparently no pre-nup. They were already separated at the time of the filing. A month later, they were said to be back together. In June 2021, the couple announced they were expecting a second child. Later that year, their son, Wave Set Cephus, was born.</p><p>Offset is no stranger to run-ins with the law, and previously received felony convictions for burglary and theft. Following a violation of his probation for said felonies, he was incarcerated in DeKalb County Jail, Georgia, in 2013. Then, in 2015, Offset was arrested along with Quavo and Takeoff at a Migos concert at Georgia Southern University. He was charged with possession of an unspecified Schedule II narcotic, possession of marijuana, possession of a firearm in a school safety zone, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Then, while he was still in custody, Offset was charged with battery and inciting a riot within a penal facility, following events where he attacked another inmate. He was released in December 2015 after spending eight months in custody, after accepting an Alford plea deal that would drop the gun, drug, and gang-related charges against him in exchange for his pleasing guilty to inciting a riot, and paying a $1,000 fine, serving five years of probation. Another stipulation of his plea deal was agreeing to being banished from Bulloch, Effingham, Jenkins, and Screven counties in Georgia.</p><p>In April 2019, Offset faced a felony charge for possession of three handguns and drugs from a previous arrest in July 2018. In October 2020, he was detained by the Beverly Hills Police Department for carrying a concealed weapon near a <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a> rally. He was released shortly after. In 2021, he was sued by Platinum Transportation Group, a Los Angeles car rental company, after reportedly renting a Bentley Bentayga, pushing back the return date multiple times, then claiming the car was gone and had no idea where it went.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In December 2019, it was revealed that <a href=#>Cardi B and Offset had purchased a home outside of Atlanta for $5.5 million</a>. The 22,000 square-foot home has 5 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms and sits on just under six acres. In 2017, the house was listed for $10 million. Here's a video tour of the property:</p><p></p><h2 id=career-earnings><strong>Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>Between September 2017 and September 2018, Migos earned a combined $25 million. It's presumable that Offset's cut of those gross earnings was around $8 million. That number was produced thanks largely to a grueling tour schedule that saw the group perform 93 shows in a 12 month period. They are also one of the most popular streaming acts on the planet with 4 billion streams in the same time period. Between September 2018 and September 2019, they earned $36 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6Szp7%2FErWSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a1-bentley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="a1 bentley">&larr;
