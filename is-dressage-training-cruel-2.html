The point of dressage is to demonstrate harmony and trust between horse and rider, which is achieved using correct, gentle training.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-horses-actually-enjoy-dressage></span>Do horses actually enjoy dressage?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If done properly, <b>horses shouldn’t hate dressage at all</b>. Unfortunately, however, to some people dressage means getting the horse’s head down, whether that is by use of draw reins or sawing on the bit. Of course, if a horse is in discomfort during any activity, then he will come to dislike it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-dressage-hard-on-a-horse></span>Is dressage hard on a horse?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Dressage is the ultimate competition for many horses and their riders and its popularity continues to escalate.

The concept of dressage initially began as a military idea, to train horses for war.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-horse-riding-cruel></span>Is horse riding cruel?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The race itself isn’t cruel —</b> but other aspects of the sport can be, be it overworking the horse, stabling conditions, or how frequently they are transported for races.

Once you reach an advanced level in affiliated dressage, spurs must be worn.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-spurs-cruel-to-horses></span>Are spurs cruel to horses?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Frankly put, <b>spurs do not hurt the horse if they are used correctly</b>. Spurs should never be used by an inexperienced rider: in order to use spurs, you have to be experienced enough to be able to control your leg and not squeeze the horse’s sides for support.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-horses-foam-at-the-mouth-in-dressage></span>Why do horses foam at the mouth in dressage?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Why do the horses start foaming at the mouth? … The horse will release saliva when the jaw relaxes, so the foam is actually a signal that <b>the horse is attentive, calm, and submissive</b>, and many riders will choose not to wipe off the foam even if it forms before the competition gets underway.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-spurs-legal></span>Are spurs Legal?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>a) <b>General – Spurs are optional for all three Tests</b>.

The end of the shank must be blunt and must point only towards the rear. … Only Dummy, Rollerball, Impulse, Rowelled, hammerhead & Prince of Wales Spurs are allowed to be worn.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-whips-hurt-horses></span>Do whips hurt horses?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What does a horse feel when it is struck with a whip? <b>There is no evidence to suggest that whipping does not hurt</b>. Whips can cause bruising and inflammation, however, horses do have resilient skin. That is not to say that their skin is insensitive.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-horse-riders-still-wear-spurs></span>Do horse riders still wear spurs?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The spur as an art form, as well as a tool, is still seen in western riding, where spurs with engraving and other artistic elements, often handmade and using silver or other precious metals, <b>are still worn</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-swan-neck-spurs-dressage-legal></span>Are swan neck spurs dressage legal?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If the shank is curved, the spurs must be worn only with the shank directed downwards.
