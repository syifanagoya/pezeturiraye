Founder of her own design film called Kelly Wearstler Interior Design named by The New Yorker as “the presiding grande dame of West Coast interior design.” She was a judge on every episode of Bravo’s Top Design reality show.</p><p>Celebrity clients of hers have included <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a> and <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a>.</p><p>Kelly Wearstler (born November 21, 1967) is an American designer. After founding her own design firm Kelly Wearstler Interior Design (or KWID) in the mid-1990s, her ensuing work within the hotel industry built her reputation in California, with The New Yorker dubbing her “the presiding grande dame of West Coast interior design.” According to The New York Times, “her playful, elegantly over-the-top designs for the Avalon Beverly Hills changed the look of boutique hotels around the world,” and her designs for the Viceroy hotel chain in the early 2000s have also been noted for their influence on the design industry. She has designed properties for clients such as Gwen Stefani, Cameron Diaz and Stacey Snider, and served as a judge on all episodes of Bravo’s Top Design reality contest in 2007 and 2008.</p><p>With a style periodically described as maximalism, she has been one of several designers credited with bringing “the decorative back to interior design” and mixing modern and historical designs. The New Yorker opined that since the late 1990s, “her style has evolved from mid-century modern to glammed-up Hollywood Regency to an ornate, layered look inspired in part by the late Hollywood set decorator and interior designer Tony Duquette. She uses intense colors, David Hicks-like graphic patterning, and contrasting textures (lacquer, parchment, shagreen).”</p><p align=justify>She was raised by a engineer father and mother who worked as an antique dealer. She has an older sister. She and husband Brad Korzen have sons named Oliver and Elliot.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kelly Wearstler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Kelly</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wearstler</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Interior Designer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 21</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1967</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Myrtle Beach</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Carolina</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Brad Korzen</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Oliver Korzen, Elliot Korzen</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Kelly Wearstler ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The following year she was introduced to real estate developer Brad Korzen, who hired her to design his house in the Hollywood Hills and several residential properties owned by Korzen’s company Kor Realty Group. The first of the residences was the Avalon hotel in Beverly Hills, which re-opened in 1999 with a style described in the press as “a playful take on mid-century modernism.” With apartments filled with pieces from modernist artists such as Arne Jacobsen, Eero Saarinen and George Nelson, The New York Times would write a decade later that “her playful, elegantly over-the-top designs for the Avalon Beverly Hills changed the look of boutique hotels around the world.” In 2000, she designed the small Maison 40 hotel in Beverly Hills “with a louche black-and-red interior and heavy doses of chinoiserie” for Kor Realty.</p><h2>Kelly Wearstler Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Kelly Wearstler is one of the <strong>richest Interior Designer</strong> from United States.

Her father was an engineer and her mother an antique dealer. Her mother’s interest in design had a major influence on Wearstler from a young age. She would come home from school to find rooms often painted new colors. When they were young, Wearstler and her older sister would accompany their mother to thrift shops, auctions, and flea markets, which helped develop Wearstler’s early interest in fashion and design. She started collecting vintage clothing at age 15 and later attended the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, where she took architecture classes, and obtained her bachelor’s degree in interior and graphic design. While paying her way through college by waitressing, she held internships at the design firms Cambridge Seven Associates in Boston and Milton Glaser in New York.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Interior Designer</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Her work on the Avalon and the Maison 140 led to a commission designing Viceroy Hotels and Resorts, a new chain of boutique hotels, which she gave an “almost theatrical” Hollywood aesthetic. The Viceroy in Palm Springs became “her most accomplished work” in 2001, and the design of the Viceroy that opened a year later in Santa Monica also earning praise in the press. By that time she was also working on the Viceroy Miami, and other notable designs include Viceroy Anguilla on the island of Anguilla and The Tides Hotel South Beach in Miami. Elle Decor would later write that “her luxury hotel interiors” featured “elegant bergère chairs, unexpected lacquer finishes (glistening lemon yellows, Amazon parrot greens) and old-style stately wallpapers.” As of 2002 she had also completed design projects for clients such as Mercury Records, Ben Stiller, and Jeanne Tripplehorn. In 2006 Wearstler designed the restaurant and lounge, BG Restaurant, at the Manhattan Bergdorf Goodman department store.</p><p>Wearstler and her husband, Brad Korzen, married in 2002 and now have two sons, Oliver and Elliot. The family has remodeled and sold a number of houses in Southern California, including the former Beverly Hills estate of film producer Albert Broccoli, which they moved into and renovated in 2007. Continuing to work primarily out of Los Angeles, as of 2015, Wearstler and Korzen maintained homes in both Malibu and Beverly Hills. Wearstler is active on social media, and in early 2014, Architectural Digest included her on a list of 15 Must-Follow Designers and Architects on Instagram.

In 1992 she was a production assistant on HouseSitter, and the following year she served as an uncredited assistant art director on So I Married an Axe Murderer. After working small roles on several sets she decided not to pursue a film career, though the experience did lead to an interior design commission from a film producer. While working as a hostess at a Beverly Hills restaurant in 1994, Wearstler was scouted by Marilyn Grabowski, who at the time was a photography editor for Playboy. The meeting led to Wearstler being featured as the September Playmate of the Month under the name Kelly Gallagher, in what The New Yorker described as a “neoclassical” shoot by photographers Arny Freytag and Stephen Wayda. Excluding several future cameos in Playboy documentaries, Wearstler’s association with the franchise was relatively fleeting, and she used the money from Playboy to pay off student loans and help start her interior design business.</p><p align=justify>With filming starting in 2006, she served as one of three primary judges on Top Design, a reality show contest that premiered on Bravo in January 2007. Wearstler appeared in all twenty episodes before the show’s end in 2008, and attracted a fair degree of attention in the press with the outfits she wore while judging. The New Yorker wrote in 2009 that “most people, including her fellow-judge Jonathan Adler, say they watched just for Wearstler’s getups,” with The New York Times writing that “Wearstler’s fondness for pastiche in fashion garnered a lot of attention… but those hats aren’t calculated.” The latter article quoted Wearstler stating that “sometimes I might look a little crazy, but sometimes beautiful things happen. I don’t take it too seriously.’’ In 2007, she was named to Vogue’s Top Ten Best Dressed list, and also that year TIME named her to its Style & Design 100 list of international creative professionals.</p><h2>Who is Kelly Wearstler Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Kelly Wearstler</strong> married to <strong>Brad Korzen </strong>.

David Colman of the New York Times described it as “a kind of lavish brochure for Ms. Wearstler’s vision (she has a fabric line and has carpet, furniture and china lines in the works), which involves a decadent Hollywood riposte to Martha Stewart’s stolidly tasteful East Coast domesticity.”</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Kelly Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Interior Designer</strong>.
